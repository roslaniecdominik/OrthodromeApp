# App to visualizing the orthodrome between two any places on the plane and on the sphere.

## Flask  Python | JS | HTML | CSS

### What is the orthodrome?
The shortest path between two points on the surface of a sphere along its surface.

### Description
The following application calculates the length between given points on the Earth's surface and then calculates the azimuth at both points. Based on this data, the algorithm calculates the coordinates of points on a flat map that lie on the orthodrome between the starting and ending points.

User can select a city or enter any coordinates.
The application calculates the distance between points on an ellipsoid and visualizes the results on a flat map and on a 3D earth model
